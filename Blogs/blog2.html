      Samsung Electronics announced today it has merged its mobile and consumer
      electronics units and unveiled its new leadership to replace its three
      major divisions leaders, effective starting today (Dec.7), in the
      company’s biggest shake-up since 2017. Jong-Hee (JH) Han, head of visual
      display business, was promoted to vice chairman and co-CEO and will lead
      the newly merged mobile and consumer electronics unit, which is also
      called SET division, and continue to head the visual display business.
    </p>
    <p class="container container-center">
      Han, who played a key role in the company achieving the company’s top
      position in global TV sales for the last 15 years, is expected to
      “strengthen the synergies among the different businesses in the SET
      division and help drive new business and technologies,” Samsung said.
      Kyehyun Kyung, CEO of Samsung Elecro-Mechanics, was also named co-CEO of
      Samsung Electronics and will lead the company’s device solutions (DS)
      division spanning semiconductor and components units.
    </p>
    <p class="container container-center">
      The tech giant said the new leadership will help lead “the next phase of
      the company’s future growth and to strengthen its business
      competitiveness.” The consolidation of its two main units, mobile and
      consumer electronics, is seen as an effort to simplify its structures and
      focus more on the semiconductor business. The sweeping reshuffle
      announcement comes roughly four months after the company’s vice president
      and de facto leader Jay Y. Lee was released on parole in August.
