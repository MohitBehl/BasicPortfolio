      In a statement, Equinix acknowledged that acquiring MainOne is the first
      step in its long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral
      digital infrastructure company. “With more than 200 million people,
      Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and, along with Ghana, has become an
      established data center hub. This makes the acquisition a pivotal entry
      point for Equinix into the continent,” the company said in the statement.
      Funke Opeke started MainOne in 2010 after noticing the poor internet
      connectivity Nigerians had to deal with upon her return to the West
      African country from the U.S.

    <p class="container container-center">
      Armed with over $100 million in investments, Opeke built MainOne as West
      Africa’s first privately owned, open access undersea high capacity cable
      submarine. It’s a 7,000-kilometer cable stretching from Portugal to West
      Africa with landings along Accra in Ghana, Dakar in Senegal, Abidjan in
      the Ivory Coast and Lagos in Nigeria.

      MainOne’s services are used by over 800 business-to-business customers.
      They include major international technology enterprises, social media
      companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service
      companies and cloud service providers. Having enabled connectivity for
      these businesses via three operational data centers, MainOne plans to open
      an additional facility in Q1 2022, a move that coincides with Equinix’s
      acquisition. MainOne, which has a 500-person team, said its facilities
      generate approximately US$60M annualized revenue with a purchase multiple
      of approximately 14x EBITDA. Upon closing, these facilities will add more
      than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Equinix, with 570,000 square
      feet of land for future expansions.
